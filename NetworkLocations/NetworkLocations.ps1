Hey SysAdmin -
It's really hard remembering all those different network shares you need to touch every day right?  I know, well stop crying and fix it.  Just 3 easy steps! 
1 - Set your top list of network unc paths below
2 - Add this script to your powershell profile 
3 - Run 'netloc' or 'NetworkLocations' command from any powershell to launch a menu to select and open a network location in a windows explorer session
Don't say 'But what about shortcuts?' this is shorter than shortcuts (and cooler).  You know Windows â™¥ backslashes! 
Decades of typing backslashes - gone *poof*
You're welcome. -JN

function NetworkLocations {
    # Locations should be root unc shares (not subfolders inside shares)
    # Some endpoint that will invoke windows auth when path is called by the shell below
    $Locations = @(
        "\\localhost\c$"
        "\\server1\c$"
        "\\server2\c$"
        "\\server3\c$"
        "\\server4\c$"
    )
    $Selection = $Locations | Sort-Object | Out-GridView -PassThru 
    Write-Host $Selection
    Invoke-Item $Selection
}

Set-Alias -Name netloc -Value NetworkLocations
#Set-Alias -Name makeyourown -Value NetworkLocations
